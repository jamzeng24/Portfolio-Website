# Portfolio Website

This is a GitHub repository of the current iteration of my portfolio website, with hopefully more different styles and techniques in later versions. What started as a personal project to just get a website up and running for an online documentation of my portfolio turned into a small weekend project where I discovered and learned new technologies.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Requirements

Node.js

## Getting Started

Build, then start the server:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment

This application is deployed at [https://portfolio-website-9u05sscxz-jamzeng24.vercel.app](https://portfolio-website-9u05sscxz-jamzeng24.vercel.app).
